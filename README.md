# Unofficial Github Copilot integration with Eclipse

![Scanner completion](images/scanner_completion.png)

# Features
- Content assist completions

# Warning
This integration is an unofficial prototype. Consider trying Copilot with [officially supported tools](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot).
Copilot is a cloud-based service provided by Github and only works with [a paid subscription](https://github.com/settings/copilot). 

# Prerequisites
- [Copilot for Neovim](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot?tool=neovim) (no need for Neovim itself)
- Node.js [17 or *below*](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot?tool=neovim#prerequisites-3)
- Java 17 or newer
- Eclipse IDE should be configured to use Java 17 or newer

# Usage
- Download [the latest Copilot for Eclipse](https://github.com/vgcpge/eclipse.copilot/releases/latest/download/update-site.zip). It comes as an archived update site.
- Follow [instructions](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-124.htm) to install the Copilot feature from the archived update site.
- A warning dialog "Trust" will request a confirmation to install unsigned content. Install on your own risk and consider gifting me a code-signing certificate.
- When editing a text file (any source code file counts) for the first time, plug-in will request permission to access Github Copilot in your default web browser. An error will be shown if you don't have Copilot subscription.
- A modal dialog will be shown with a code to supply in the browser. Once granted, permission is remembered by Copilot, this is a one-time operation.

# Java
To work with Java Development Tools (JDT), install additionally "JDT Integration for LSP4E" from the main Eclipse update site.
You may want to remove less useful completion assistants from Preferences/Java/Editor/Content Assist/Advanced. Leave "Language Server Proposals" enabled.

# MacOS
There is no convenient way to configure environment variables for GUI apps on MacOS. For this reason the plugin looks for Node.js executable in /opt/homebrew/bin/node.
If your Node.js is installed elsewhere, run Eclipse from terminal with PATH preconfigured.

# Credits
- This integration relies on [Eclipse LSP4E - Language Server Protocol client for Eclipse IDE](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4e)
- Inspriration for this project comes from the first attempt by [masecla22](https://github.com/masecla22/eclipse-github-copilot-integration). No code have been reused from that project here.
